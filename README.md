I've written this raycaster following Permadi's paper, as a pilgrimage to my God John Carmack.

I've loved the time I've spent on it! May continue working on it in the future.

Features:
- Rendering 640x480
- Player Input (Walk forward/backwards, rotate, strafe)
- Textured Walls, Floors and Ceilings
- Shading and Map Lighting
- Load map from file
- Assets Manager (different values in the map files are different walls)
- Minimap
- Fixed Time Step
