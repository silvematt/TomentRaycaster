I've written this raycaster following Permadi's paper and Wolfenstein 3D code (and Black Book), as a pilgrimage to my God John Carmack.

I've loved the time I've spent on it, it's a work in progress with other features on schedule :)

Features:
- Rendering 640x480
- Player Input (Walk forward/backwards, rotate, strafe, interact)
- Textured Walls, Floors and Ceilings
- Thin (offsetted) Walls
- Sliding Doors
- Sprites Rendering & Physics (Sprites can be solid or not)
- Shading and Map Lighting
- Load map from file
- Assets Manager (different values in the map files are different walls/floors/ceilings)
- Minimap
- Fixed Time Step
